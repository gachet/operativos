# CSCI 375 -  Operating Systems - Spring 2019

## Course Description

This class introduces the basic facilities provided in modern operating systems. The course divides into three major sections. The first part of the course discusses concurrency: how to manage multiple tasks that execute at the same time and share resources. Topics in this section include processes and threads, context switching, synchronization, scheduling, and deadlock. The second part of the course addresses the problem of memory management; it will cover topics such as linking, dynamic memory allocation, dynamic address translation, virtual memory, and demand paging. The third major part of the course concerns file systems, including topics such as storage devices, disk management and scheduling, directories, protection, and crash recovery. After these three major topics, the class will conclude with a few smaller topics such as virtual machines.

## Grading

- Programming Projects: 50%
- Quizzes: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

### Programming Projects

The programming assignments will involve writing C code to gain experience using low-level operating system services. You are not required to know the C programming language before starting this course.  The assignments may be structured into multiple deliverables. There will be approximately four programming projects.

### Quizzes
Starting in the third week of class we will be having **weekly quizzes** unless otherwise noted on the course schedule or announced in class.  The quizzes will be designed to take about 15-20 minutes at the start of class.  The quizzes will primarily focus on the material covered in class and in the assigned reading since the last quiz. The **lowest two (2)** grades will be dropped from your final grade.  Because of this policy, the instructor **will not** be offering make-up quizzes for those who miss them.

### Final Exam
The final exam will be in written format, to be completed in class.  The final exam will take place during the University-set time. The final exam will be cumulative.

## Academic Integrity & Collaboration
Most of the assignments may be completed in small groups of 2 to no more than 3 students. For all of the assignments in this course, it is reasonable to discuss general approaches to problem solutions with students outside of your designated group. However, the bulk of the work must be completed by the designated group members. Sharing or copying code from anyone inside or outside of the class, other than your designated group members, will be treated as a violation of the academic integrity rules. You are expected to be able to individually, fully explain the results obtained for an assignment (including code produced), and may be asked to do so for any given assignment.

## Responsibilities
Students are expected to attend all classes and take the exams at the scheduled times. Assigned readings, exercises and projects must be completed on time.

## Academic Honesty
Cheating on exams or copying projects will not be tolerated. Please review the College's policies on Plagiarism and Cheating. Moreover, if you copy projects, you will not be able to answer questions on the exams.

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will not be taken formally.  However, I hope you will attend all class sessions. Class time will not be taken to review things missed due to lack of attendance. If you do have to miss a class, speak to your classmates about what you missed, and try to get notes and other materials from them.

**None: Syllabus and classroom polices are subject to change.**
